Portable Game Launcher

A Python-based, portable game launcher for Windows. Run games directly from a USB stick while automatically syncing save files with the PC’s AppData folder. Features EXE icons, progress indicators for file transfers, and a scrollable interface for large game libraries.

Features

Launch games directly from a USB drive.

Automatic save file synchronization between USB and PC AppData.

EXE icons displayed on game buttons.

Progress indicator when copying save files.

Scrollable interface for many games.

First-time setup for EXE paths and save directories.

Requirements

Windows OS

Python 3.8+

Python packages:

pip install pillow pywin32

Folder Structure
Launcher/
│
├─ launcher.py               # Main Python launcher script
└─ Games/
   ├─ Game1/
   │  └─ config.json        # Automatically created for EXE and save path
   ├─ Game2/
   │  └─ config.json
   └─ ...


Each game has its own folder in Games/.

Saves/ inside each game folder stores save files for USB synchronization.

config.json stores the EXE path and AppData save folder (created on first launch).

Usage

Copy the launcher folder to a USB stick.

Place each game in its own folder inside Games/.

Run launcher.py on any Windows PC.

First time launching a game:

Select the game’s EXE file.

Enter the AppData save folder (e.g., LocalLow\GameName).

The launcher automatically copies save files between USB and PC when starting and closing the game.

Scroll through the list if there are too many games to fit in the window.

Notes

Only tested on Windows; EXE icon extraction uses Windows APIs.

For portable use on multiple PCs, convert launcher.py to EXE using PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile launcher.py


The launcher works best with portable games or games where save files are stored in AppData.

Antiviruses may occasionally flag Python-created EXEs – mark as safe if necessary.
